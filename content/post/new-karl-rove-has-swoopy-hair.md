We have a new Karl Rove. The last one looked like [the little evil scientist from the Avengers](/img/posts/2016/karl_rove_avengers.jpg) and the new one looks like a Philip Seymour Hoffman character (think "Mission Impossible" and less "Almost Famous").

Everyone welcome your new administration's "Chief Strategist," Stephen Bannon! He's the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, "Guy that thought of all the really messed up stuff" from the Trump campaign, and now he's strategizing for your government...and really the world if you think about it. But don't.

From [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/13/trump-draws-sharp-rebuke-concerns-over-newly-appointed-chief-white-house-strategist/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_pp-bannon-9pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory):

> The Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate-watch group, has accused Breitbart of explicitly embracing ethno-nationalism. After Bannon's elevation was announced, the law center tweeted several controversial stories written by Breitbart under Bannon's control, including a piece published two weeks after a mass killing at a black church in Charleston, S.C., last year: “Hoist it high and proud: the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage.”

> “Stephen Bannon was the main driver behind Breitbart becoming a white ethno-nationalist propaganda mill,” the law center wrote via Twitter in its first statements on Bannon’s elevation. “Trump should rescind this hire. In his victory speech, Trump said he intended to be president for 'all Americans.' Bannon should go.”

Just don't look him in the eye!

> Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor who worked closely with Bannon, called him a “legitimately sinister figure” in an article he published on the Daily Wire after Bannon joined the Trump campaign.

> “Many former employees of Breitbart News are afraid of Steve Bannon. He is a vindictive, nasty figure, infamous for verbally abusing supposed friends and threatening enemies,” Shapiro wrote.

Well he sounds just fantastic and we heard he narrowly beat out [Skeletor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zloWEvRDhgI) and [this generic cartoon villain](/img/posts/2016/cartoon_vilian.png) for the job so obviously he has a lot to offer. Here's some more stuff to know about a guy described as a "legitimately sinister" and who's job it will be to think up stuff the most powerful government in the world should do.

1. According to [this Bloomberg profile](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/graphics/2015-steve-bannon/) we learn that "Honey badget don't give a s---" is his motto and that he really shouldn't be wearing shorts.

2. He's just a regular guy who's all about the people...also, he received his MBA from Harvard, he's on at least two executive boards, and is still the CEO of American Vantage Media Corporation.

3. He's still formally attached to the Breitbart media. He's simply "on leave" and not even bothering to hide any conflict with the alt-right website.

4. He likes to wear grey t-shirts under his dress shirts. I bet he's one of those guys that immediately untucks and unbuttons the moment he gets home and does one of those gross "uuuuggggggghhhhhh" sounds.

5. This is totally a guess, but he seems like a guy that doesn't bother to hold in his farts at the office.
