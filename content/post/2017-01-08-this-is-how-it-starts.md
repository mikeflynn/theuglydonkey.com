Per NBC sources and CNN's Brian Stelter, this tweet from the President Elect is a flat out lie:

Nothing is a surprise at this point, but this is how it starts. We're not in campaign mode (as if that was an excuse), we're in governing mode now and destroying the nation's respect for the media is what all propagandizing scary world leaders do. It's happened over and over again because removing the fact-checkers from the equation gives scary world leaders the ability to do what they want and change the message so that they look good while doing whatever horrible thing they want to do. The next step is usually to have a media outlet controlled by the government that will get all the "exclusive" information and when that happens we'll really be fuc...oh, right: [breitbart.com](http://www.breitbart.com/)

Here we go. Welcome to your new world power run like a South American dictatorship.
