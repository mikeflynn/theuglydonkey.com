I'm going to drop something on you that many Democrats with Facebook accounts won't want to hear: Give it a rest on the "disband the electoral college" stuff.

The electoral college may have it's faults, but that's the game. Those were the rules, and just because everyone (and I do mean [everyone](https://politicalwire.com/2016/11/10/trump-shocked-won/)) shat a collective brick on November 8th, doesn't mean we need [a Change.org petition](https://www.change.org/p/electoral-college-electors-electoral-college-make-hillary-clinton-president-on-december-19?source_location=discover_feed) to reset the rules after the game is over.

For starters the optics on this whole push are _terrible_. Your team lost and you sound just like the whiny kids that some on the right like assume all liberals are. You were shocked when Trump suggested he wouldn't concede the election, and now we're all standing around talking about how stupid the election process is! Feel the need to complain about something on Facebook? Why don't you tackle Trump himself or maybe debunk fake news stories, but going on and on about this is a complete waste of time when we have bigger issues that need to stay in focus (see: [How Many Warning Signs Do You Need?](/2016/11/how-many-warning-signs-do-you-need/)).

Here's the other detail you don't want to hear: Even if 2016 was a popular vote election, Trump still might have won. Yes, Clinton has a near historic lead in the popular vote for an election loser, but campaigns are run based on the rules of the electoral college. If the goal was the popular vote both Trump and Clinton would have rolled out very different strategies. We don't know how those strategies would have played out, but if  you have someone telling you they _know_ Clinton would have won because of the numbers suggest...the numbers suggest this: *fart sound*. No one knew anything about this election, and that includes the pollsters and both campaigns.

No, the Electoral College [will not elect Clinton anyway](http://www.factcheck.org/2016/11/could-electoral-college-elect-clinton/).

No, [the Electoral College isn't perfect](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/11/17/the-electoral-college-badly-distorts-the-vote-and-its-going-to-get-worse/), but Obama didn't have any problem with it (and when that happened the GOP complained that the electoral college favored the Dems).

No, this is not the best time to get rid of the Electoral College. The best time would be after a landslide where everyone can agree to reform without looking like sore losers.

Despite what you may think or have read, the electoral college, which for whatever reason is difficult for me to accurately type so I really hate this column, it's not the reason Trump won. Think of it like the can-shaped blob of cranberry sauce on your Thanksgiving table: It's weird, it could certainly be improved and maybe it should just go away, but everyone accepted it in the past so you just need to deal with it right now. Take a slice and keep trying to smile while you push back against your racist uncle's somewhat subdued political jubilation.
