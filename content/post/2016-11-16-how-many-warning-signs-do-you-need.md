Ok, it's time. Good for you for being a trooper. You're a wonderful American. Seriously, you're great. We all really appreciate you finding the inner strength to tell everyone on Facebook to calm down and "Let's just see what happens." with President-elect Trump. "He's a wild card!" you've said. "No one knows what he's going to do!" you said without realizing how terrifying that statement really is. You're a calming influence and we all love you for it.

But that was last week.

Trump's done stuff now.

"Oh how much could he have done?" You'll say.

Well...

### 1. He selected a [swoopy-haired](/2016/11/the-new-karl-rove-has-swoopy-hair/) alt-right, white nationalist to be his Chief Strategist.

We've covered this, but to review Stephen Bannon is a terrible sign for the administration. There's lot of reasons, but here's one: The American Nazi Party released a statement describing the pleasant surprise of the Bannon selection!

> I must admit that I was a wee bit surprised that Mr. Trump finally chose Mr. Bannon, I thought that his stable of Washington insiders would have objected too vociferously. Perhaps The Donald IS for ‘REAL’ and is not going to be another controlled puppet directed by the usual ‘Wire Pullers,’ and does indeed intend to ROCK the BOAT? Time will tell.

When actual, non-hyperbolic Nazis look at something the next President of the United States does and says "Wow, seriously?! That's freaking great!" ...well, that's just pretty f*cked up.

### 2. He's keeping the press at a distance.

Trump has now ditched his press pool twice and has yet to have a press conference. Say what you will about "the media," and several major news organizations have some stuff to work out, but the press need access to the President because _you_ need access to the President. The President works for us and the press pool keeps us in the loop of what's going on and what he's doing. If you don't have anything to hide, you'll respect the importance of the press. It's just that simple.

### 3. His conflicts of interest are unprecedented.

Trump is not the first rich president we have had or will have. Trump is, however, appears to be the first president that cares so little about this nation that he isn't putting a huge wall between the office of the President, and it's ultimate insider information, and any business holdings. Everyone does it to avoid even the appearance of impropriety...except Trump, and he stands to make a massive profit because of it. Of course, that's just the one conflict of interest we know about. There's still the matter of his unreleased tax records that could show any number of connections that are unflattering for the leader of the free world.

Lets stop there. That's enough, right? Without even mentioning any of the lies or bigotry he said on the campaign trail (you don't get to just brush that off as rhetoric), and purposefully leaving out any discussion of rumored future executive actions (Muslim registry), we're already at three terrible judgment calls in a little over a week of being elected President!

No, I don't think it's time to march the mob down Pennsylvania Ave, but it's time we stop "giving him a chance" or debating whether or not he is "actually a racist" because it doesn't matter. We don't need to hypothesize on future actions, because have plenty to react to right now.

Stay calm. Pay attention. Be ready to push back. (Keep coming back here every day.)
