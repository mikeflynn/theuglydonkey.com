A friend of mine, Andy Upchurch, posted the following question on the Trump cabinet appointments on Facebook:

> I'm really trying to understand how the selection of Steve Bannon is a good thing from a pro-Trump perspective. Bannon *might* not personally be an alt-right white nationalist, but under his leadership, Breitbart certainly pandered to that demographic. Then again, he might actually be an alt-right white nationalist.
> Either way, he seems like he would be a liability, unless one either believes that white nationalism will become the social norm again OR that Bannon's previous promotion of white nationalism is irrelevant in one of the President's chief advisors.
> Is this something we should just "wait and see" and not be concerned about?

Regardless of your thoughts on Steve Bannon, this is a reasonable question about the the still-forming Trump administration and how Trump is working through the process of bringing together a team. The question is nevertheless unanswerable because it is based on the assumption that Trump has a process to work through. According to all the available insider information, Trump is simply asking his friends what job they want. Questions to the Trump team regarding any plans on making a sweet tree house for cabinet meetings went unanswered.

How do we know this? Because [The New York Times is reporting](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/donald-trump-transition.html) that one of his friends essentially said "Thanks but this feels crazy that you would want me for that job."

>Ben Carson spent months trying to persuade voters to elect him president, but, according to his spokesman, he does not think he is qualified to run a federal agency in the Trump administration.
>According to the spokesman, Armstrong Williams, who is also Mr. Carson’s business manager, Mr. Trump offered the retired neurosurgeon a “buffet” of job options as a reward for being a loyal ally after dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination.
>
>“The president-elect said, ‘Ben, tell me whatever you want to run, it will be yours,’” Mr. Williams recounted.
> But Mr. Carson has no experience running large enterprises, Mr. Williams said, and did not think it would be a wise move to start in the new administration.

Ben Carson. Ben _Freaking_ Carson! Trump's in there dealing out positions like hookers to a high-roller in one of his casinos, and Ben Carson turns him down. If you're in a room full of people and the guy who thinks being gay must be a choice because "a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight— and when they come out, they’re gay," starts acting like the calm rational one, you need to get the hell out of that room before Giuliani starts in with the locker room talk!

In case you were wondering...

> Mr. Carson had been discussed as a candidate to lead the Department of Health and Human Services or the Department of Education, or to be surgeon general.

We could have had Ben Carson as our Surgeon General. This is tough to say...but..._ahem_...thank you, Ben Carson. Feel free to pretend that [the Jesus in your painting selfie](http://www.snopes.com/ben-carson-jesus-painting/) is extra proud of you today.

So, is the Bannon appointment trouble for Trump? Yes. The optics are terrible for a new administration that half of the nation is already freaking out about, but even if you're in the pro-Trump camp, there's no reason for someone like that to be officially associated with the administration. Even if you're a huge racist anti-semitic asshole (look deep in to your soul), wouldn't you rather Trump just simply take Bannon's advice quietly without bringing a lot of attention and skepticism to the connection and every decision the administration makes? Of course. He can be a "top advisor" any number of ways, but the position is a gift because he helped Trump get there. It's like a buying pizza for the friends that helped you move, but instead of pizza it's senior positions in the world's most important government, and instead of moving it was becoming President of the United States of America...and not really moving because he wants to just stay at Trump Tower.
