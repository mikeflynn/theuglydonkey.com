If you think the Pence vs Smithers thing isn't quite a match, I'm [_shocked_](http://www.snopes.com/mike-pence-supported-gay-conversion-therapy/)! Don't you think this is exactly how Pence would act if cornered by strippers?

In this Simpsons vs Frightening Reality mash-up I have going, here's the rest of the cast:

Homer: Chris Christie<br />
Lenny: Marco Rubio<br />
Carl: Ben Carson (Ugh, I know.)<br />
Inanimate Carbon Rod: Rance Priebus<br />
Frank Grimes: Collectively all of Chris Christie's aides<br />
