The flames coming off the James Comey effigy that the Clinton campaign constructed are still hot, but lets talk about what's next for the Democrats. Well, maybe not _next_. Next is spending four years being this guy: `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` while Trump and the actual Republicans see if they can remember how congress works after years of trying to stop it.

If we manage to avoid a Trump administration Twitter fight with Putin and the subsequent nuclear winter, then at some point the DNC will stop worrying about the Clinton campaigns' miscalculations or the Subreddit about how Bernie was robbed, and will start to look around for the next leader of the party. Right now it looks bleak and frankly if it wasn't for Obama's sudden rise it's been pretty bare since _Mr._ Clinton. The fact is, Democrats are leaderless and that's especially true in the new populist world order where the issues mean far less than star power and bluster. That's not to say the DNC should find their own Trump and get Michael Moore to run (though, a regular run of some kind wouldn't be a terrible idea for the man), but you have to find a leader who can deliver the issues with enough reach to match someone like Donald Trump. Polling data (feel free to scoff) also shows that plenty of people thought that Trump won the debates, which is still hard to get my head around, but clearly the Clinton campaign erred again thinking that the "simile while he calls my husband a rapist" strategy wasn't working for everyone. The next candidate will need to bring a little more thunder.

So...ok, I realize you most likely already read the title of this post and you know where this is going, so first let's talk about who the leader of the party can't be in 2020:

### Bernie

I don't want to turn this article in to a Facebook comments thread, but here's the quick version: He'll be 79 years old in 2020 and he still called himself a socialist.

### Tim Kaine

I like Time Kaine. Lets just get that out of the way before I ask you to remember how everyone used to talk about Mike Pence's political career if/when Trump looses? The theory goes that you can't tie yourself to that kind of campaign than then just shake it off like it never happened. That theory cuts both ways. Anyone involved in the most shocking political defeat of our collective lifetimes is burnt. Do you really want to see three 2020 debates with Trump (or a Trump apostle) calling Kaine "a loser" for 90 minutes...and not being completely off base.

### Michelle Obama

It's a fun thought after watching her work the campaign trail, but it's too early. If she wants this, she'll find an open congressional seat somewhere (Illinois is all booked up) first.

### Elizabeth Warren

Maybe. I think she'd have trouble in the general election, plus I think she'd probably be better suited to be the attack-dog VP to...

## Al Franken

Here we are. You made it all the way down to this buried lede. Lets do a list. You've earned it.

Al Franken crosses more requirements off than anyone else on the Democratic bench:

* He's right next to Elizabeth Warren on [the GovTrack ideology score](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/alan_franken/412378), so he should be sufficiently left-leaning to get through the primaries.
* GovTrack also ranks Franken as the [#1 senator for bill cosponsorship](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/alan_franken/412378/report-card/2015) which shows he works with a lot of different people.
* [Only 27% of those co-sponsorship were with Republicans](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/alan_franken/412378/report-card/2015), but that doesn't feel too low these days. For comparison sake, Paul Ryan sits at 5%.
* Yes, he's a comedian, so plenty of on-camera experience and he has the ability to defuse opposing bluster better than Hillary Clinton.
* He won his 2014 reelection bid with [53.9% of the vote](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/04/upshot/senate-maps.html).
* He's from Minnesota, which barely went for Clinton and sits next to Wisconsin and Michigan which together form the part of the country the Clinton campaign collectively referred to as "Where?"
* He's a white dude. (It's not fair, but it still helps.)

I have no idea if he wants to be president. Maybe he wants to just be a senator for another term, but as of today Al Franken is my best bet to push back in 2020.
