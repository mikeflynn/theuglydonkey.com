[The New York Times has reported](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/us/politics/hillary-clinton-wins-new-hampshire.html?ref=politics) that Hillary Clinton has won New Hampshire and the 4 electoral votes from the state. She still lost by 60 but thanks for bringing back up again.

> The win still leaves Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, about 60 Electoral College votes shy of Mr. Trump, who stunned many over the past 18 months with his improbable rise to the nationâ€™s highest office. Mrs. Clinton now has 232 electoral votes; Mr. Trump has 290, 20 more than the 270 needed to win.

The important thing is that the people of New Hampshire join the list of states that can smile smugly at the other people in their "[Red Dawn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_I4WgBfETc)" internment camp.
