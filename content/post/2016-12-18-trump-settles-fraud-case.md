Is this old news? So what. Don't ever forget your President-Elect settled a fraud case for $25 Million dollars. You don't settle fraud cases if you didn't commit fraud.

Trump did not, however, admit fault regarding the claims that customers were cheated.

That last part is why you settle. If you just flat out lose you don't get to pretend you didn't do anything wrong...but you still settled...for $25 Million dollars.

It's not old news. It's just news, and even bigger news for someone who ran on the flimsy platform of removing corruption.
